Welcome to **SwarmSync**, a cutting-edge platform for building **AI-powered agent swarms** that collaborate like elite human teams. Our vertical multi-agent swarms autonomously handle complex tasksâ€”software development, market research, operational workflowsâ€”**10x faster** and at a fraction of the cost.

ðŸŒŸ **Why SwarmSync?**  
Unlike single-agent AI or rigid automation tools, SwarmSync's swarms mimic human teamwork with **dynamic task allocation**, **multi-turn decision-making**, and seamless integration with tools like Search Engines, Web Browsers, GitHub, and Linear. We're also working on **MCP setup** to enhance agentic capabilities, bringing even smoother collaboration.

## Concepts

- **Human-Like Collaboration**: Role-based AI agents (e.g., PM, Developer, Researcher) work together autonomously, with dynamic task allocation and multi-turn decision-making.
- **Vertical AI Swarms**: Specialized swarms tailored for domains like software development, research, or operations, syncing tasks with human-like precision.

## SDK

Build custom swarms programmatically with the SwarmSync SDK.

Install the SDK:

```bash
pip install swarmsync-sdk # Releasing soon! Stay tuned for our SDK documentation and examples.
```

Example usage:
```python
# Coming soon! Stay tuned for our SDK documentation and examples.
```

## Acknowledgements
We'd like to acknowledge the excellent work of the open-source community, especially:

-   [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) (data validation) and [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) (advanced agent framework)

We're committed to continuing to build the SwarmSync Agents SDK as an open-source framework so others in the community can expand on our approach.
